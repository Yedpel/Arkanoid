# Arkanoid Game

Welcome to the Arkanoid Game, the final product of a comprehensive 5-part semester project in Java. This game was developed during the 2nd semester of my 1st year at BIU. Through this project, I significantly enhanced my skills in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Java development.

## Features
- Classic Arkanoid gameplay with modern enhancements.
- Smooth controls and responsive gameplay.
- A visually appealing interface with intuitive design.

## Requirements
- **Java SE 10 or higher** must be installed on your machine.

## How to Run the Game

### **Option 1: Running the Game with the Precompiled JAR (Recommended)**
1. **Download** the `finalGame.jar` file.
2. Ensure that **Java SE 10 or higher** is installed on your machine.
3. **Double-click** the `finalGame.jar` file.
4. The game will **launch automatically** and you can start playing immediately.

### Option 2: Running via Java IDE
1. **Download or Clone** the entire source code from the repository.
2. **Open** the project in any Java IDE of your choice.
3. Ensure you have the `biuoop-1.4.jar` file included in your project’s classpath.
4. **Compile and run** the `Ass6Game.java` file located in the `ass6/src/` directory.

Once you've launched the game using one of the methods outlined above, you can control the paddle using the left (`←`) and right (`→`) arrow keys.

## Gameplay Instructions

The game includes 3 challenging levels, which are illustrated in the images below.

Good luck, and enjoy the game!
